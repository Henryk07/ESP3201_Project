### for Machine Learning Purpose and testing as well.

everything will appear, just relax and try to fix it

### Meaning of each dataset

Small_dataset:

S_data_labels_cb_bw means with label combined train and test together
and in black and write

S_prediction_datas_labels means with label for prediction

S_prediction_datas_labels_bw means with label and in black and write for prediction

S_testing_datas_labels means with label not combined train and test together

S_training_datas_labels means with label not combined train and test together
